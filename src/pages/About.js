        About this site This is a simple Hacker News clone, built with
        SvelteKit, an application framework for Svelte. Svelte is a new kind of
        framework, one that compiles your component templates into fast, compact
        JavaScript â€” either client-side or server-side. You can read more about
        the design and philosophy in the introductory blog post. We're using
        hnpwa-api as a backend. The app is hosted on Vercel.
